# GSU_Praat_Tools
Scripts for Praat

These scripts were from Professor Michael Owren (deceased). I was his lab manager from 2005/06 and worked on some of these scripts that he later published here:
Owren, M. J. (2008). GSU Praat Tools: Scripts for modifying and analyzing sounds using Praat acoustics software. Behavior research methods, 40(3), 822-829.

However, after he died, the google site where he was curating the scripts seems to have disappeared, so I am providing my copies here for my use and others, who might find them useful.
